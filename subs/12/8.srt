00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,340
我就知道你会这么说
I was hoping you'd say that.

99
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,890
这样合法吗
Is that legal?

100
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,020
不
No.

101
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,690
但你想进去劝架吗
But are you going to go in there and tell him?

102
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,700
我有我的法律权利  你这混蛋
I've got rights, you asshole!

103
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,700
今天你什么都没有
Not today.

104
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,580
不要  不要
No, no!

105
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,340
-他开口了吗  -以后什么也说不了啦
- Well, is he talking? - Not anymore.

106
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,510
那房间有监听器
That room is bugged, Hobbs.

107
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,890
所以你得到的消息  国际刑警组织都知道
So, any information you just beat out of him, Interpol has now.

108
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,890
好极了  今天早上可以休息了  肖在伦敦
Great. Now they can take the morning off. Shaw's in London.

109
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,100
那我们去抓他吧
Let's go pick him up.

110
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,850
小姐  欧文・肖可不是想抓就抓的
Woman, you just don't pick up Owen Shaw like he's groceries.

111
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,400
对付他要以暴制暴
If you want to catch wolves, you need wolves.

112
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,190
捕猎开始了
Let's go hunting.

113
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,670
你这一亿就花在这上面吗
This is what 100 million buys?

114
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,630
找你一点都不难  托雷多
It wasn't that hard to find you, Toretto.

115
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,260
我又没在躲
I wasn't hiding.

116
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,930
退休的国际罪犯生活如何
How's the life of the retired international criminal?

117
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,480
我很喜欢这里  很平静
I like it here. It's quiet.

118
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,190
天气好得很
Nice weather,

119
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,650
也不用引渡
and no extradition.

120
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,320
警官  您有何贵干
So what are you doing here, cop?

121
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,860
上周二  有支训练有素的车队
Last Tuesday, a team of highly coordinated drivers

122
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,490
捣毁了一支俄国军方车队
took down an entire military convoy in Russia.

123
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,120
我可不在天冷的地方干活
I don't do cold weather.

124
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,280
我知道不是你
I know it wasn't you.

125
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,040
但你要帮我找出这支车队
But you're going to help me catch the team responsible.

126
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,000
你不需要这样
And you ain't gonna need that.

127
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,880
你不能抓他  霍布斯  他完全...
You can't touch him, Hobbs. You've got no powers...

128
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,210
我不想抓任何人
I'm not here to extradite anyone.

129
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,050
他会主动帮我的
See, he's going to come voluntarily.

130
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,840
事实上  应该说
As a matter of fact,

131
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,550
他得求我让他帮忙
he's going to beg me.

132
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,510
这是一周前的照片
This was taken a week ago.

133
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,730
门口见
I'll see you out front.

134
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,040
是拉蒂  对吧
It's Letty, isn't it?

135
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
这不可能
It's impossible.

136
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,590
如果照片上是我老公
If that was my husband,

137
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,720
如果有机会  不管多渺小
if there was a chance, no matter how small,

138
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,430
我都会奋力一搏
I would go.

139
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,450
我要知道一切  你手头一切信息
I'm going to need everything, all the info you got.

140
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,240
带来队伍  就告诉你
You'll get it when the team gets it.

141
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,750
没有队伍
No team.

142
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,750
就我一个人
This is going to have to be me alone.

143
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,500
你想得太简单了
It's not that simple.

144
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,870
这支车队
The crew we're after,

145
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,500
作案之后会马上消失  
they hit like thunder and disappear like smoke.

146
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,130
你想自己上吗  完全没有机会
You go in alone, you won't ever touch them.

147
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,310
我追这伙人
I've been chasing this

148
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,090
追了四个大洲十二个国家
guy across four continents and 12 countries,

149
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,470
所以相信我  我最不想来的地方
and believe me, the last damn place I want to be right now

150
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,770
就是在你门口  忽悠你来帮忙
is on your front doorstep, selling Girl Scout cookies.

151
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,940
我需要你的帮助  唐
I need your help, Dom.

152
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,110
我需要你的队伍
I need your team.

153
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,320
女士们  把酒满上
Okay, ladies, bring it in.

154
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,320
我来祝个酒
Listen, I want to make a toast.

155
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,660
来吧
Come on.

156
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,120
我知道你们有人已经去过澳门了
Listen, I know a few of y'all have already been to Macau,

157
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,950
但跟我一起去
but you have never seen the town

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,160
你们才知道什么叫享受
till you've seen it through my eyes.

159
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,000
我有海景顶楼套房
We got a penthouse suite

160
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,790
会改变你们人生
with an ocean view that's going to change your life.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,750
150英尺游艇  艇上有直升机
150- foot yacht with a helicopter pad...

162
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,050
应该说  我将带你们
Mmm- hmm. Safe to say,

163
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,420
见识一下极乐世界
you're about to have the time of your lives.

164
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,510
不  是你才对
No, you are.

165
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,300
干杯
Cheers.

166
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,680
快看  开着法拉利的高富帅

167
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,520
是啊  你以前可是罗宾汉  有钱大家花

168
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,760
你懂我意思的

169
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,880
钱改变了你

170
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,030
你说得对

171
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,730
钱的确改变了我

172
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,480
我意识到钱不是树上长出来的

173
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,570
是天上掉下来的

174
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,670
谢谢  看起来很好吃

175
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,310
粤语不错嘛
Nice!

176
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,190
这叫走遍世界都不怕
I'm a citizen of the world.

177
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,400
你想没想过安定下来
Ever thought about settling down?

178
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,200
一起开始一段新的人生
Starting a life together?

179
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,200
我们现在不就是这样吗
Aren't we doing that?

180
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,790
是吗
Are we?

181
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,790
放下你的枪

182
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,790
马上

183
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,310
哪位  唐
Hello? Dom?

184
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,570
我马上到
I'll be there.

185
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,030
哥们  把飞机调个头
Hey, my man, I need you to turn this plane around.

186
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,910
女士们  计划有变
All right, listen, ladies. There's been a little change of plans.

187
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,200
有临时状况
Something came up.

188
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,450
之前我跟你们说过的那家赌场
You know that casino I was telling you all about?

189
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,450
我有他们那儿
I got some vouchers

190
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,910
自助餐的代金券
to the buffet.

191
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,220
你喜欢这个吗
What do you think of this?

192
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,810
-他喜欢这个  -好吧
- He likes it. - All right.

193
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,390
是的
Yes.

194
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,600
还是这个
Or this?

195
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,730
真棒
Yes.

196
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,440
这才是我儿子  我们来试飞一下
That's my boy. All right, let's see how this thing flies.

197
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,730
在看吗
Are you watching?

198
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,620
快看谁来了  这不是唐叔叔吗
It's Uncle Dom. What do you know?

199
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,950
快招手  你好啊
Are you waving? What up?

200
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,750
好啊  杰克 
Hey, Jack.

201
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,250
你好吗司机叔叔  你好唐叔叔
What's up, Uncle Dom? What's up, Uncle Dom?

202
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,130
很高兴见到你
You excited to see him?

203
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,960
你这是已经塞车给人家了吗
Are you already pushing imports on him?

204
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,130
哪有  爸爸不会逼你做任何事
You say, "Dad's not pushing anything."

205
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,590
他自己选的这辆车
He chose that car.

206
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,300
我们知道他是奥康纳家的儿子  但是
We know he's an O'Conner, but,

207
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,590
我给你带来了这个  杰克
I brought you something, Jack.

208
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,800
太棒了  他也是托雷多家的人
Yeah! He's also a Toretto.

209
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,640
现在还不着急做出选择呢  对吧
Luckily, he has a couple more years to decide, right?

210
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,600
人家能决定了  米娅
I think he decided, Mia.

211
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,810
他该睡午觉了
I think it's time for his nap.

212
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,810
来吧宝贝
Come on, baby. Okay.

213
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,150
拜拜啦
Say bye.

214
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,780
这感觉很奇怪吧
It's weird, huh?

215
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,950
什么奇怪
What's weird?

216
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,280
我现在  有了一切
We got everything.

217
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,450
甚至还有啤酒和烧烤
You know, down to the beer and the barbeque.

218
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,830
但是...
But it just...

219
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,630
但是感觉特别不像个家
I don't know, it just doesn't feel like home.

220
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,630
也许是因为
Maybe it's because, uh,

221
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,090
有些东西  直到失去 
you don't realize how much you appreciate something

222
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,180
才会珍惜
until somebody takes it away.

223
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,010
我不知道
I don't know.

224
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,680
这地方变了许多  
The place has probably changed so much,

225
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,640
你也许认不出来了
you wouldn't even recognize it anymore.

226
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,020
是啊
Yeah.

227
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,350
一切都变了
Everything's changed.

228
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,820
你怎么样  最近忙什么呢
So what's up with you? What's going on?

229
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,160
一周之前的照片
Taken a week ago.

230
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,830
外交安全局
Diplomatic Security Service.

231
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,660
霍布斯
Hobbs.

232
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,510
我以前也经常做这种事
You know, I used to do this shit all the time as a cop.

233
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,380
因为警察就是这样  扰乱你的生活
This is exactly what cops do. He's messing with your head.

234
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,150
拉蒂死了  唐
Letty's dead, Dom.

235
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,360
我必须要确定
I need to know for sure.

236
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,860
我和你一起去
Then I'm going with you.

237
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,360
你说过  过去的都过去了
You said you were going to leave this life behind.

238
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,530
我们都说过去的人生已经过去了
We both said that we were leaving the life behind.

239
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,410
他说得对
He's right.

240
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,240
我们就像亲人
We're family.

241
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,450
有难就要同当
If we got a problem, we deal with it together.

242
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,120
知道你们在外面互相扶持
And I'll feel safer knowing you're both out there,

243
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,420
我也会安心一点
watching each other's backs.

244
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,710
你们联手会更强大  一直都是这样
You're stronger together. You always were.

245
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,090
去找拉蒂吧
Now go get Letty.

246
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,720
带她回家
Bring her home.

247
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,790
伦敦

248
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,820
谢天谢地
Thank God!

249
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,910
终于有像样的装备了
Finally, some equipment I can work with.

250
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,120
好吗  小子
What up, boy?

251
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,910
比在里约的那堆垃圾强多了
This is way better than that trash in Rio.

252
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,120
强太多了
Way better.

253
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,630
你对他们有把握吗
You sure about these guys?

254
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,300
没有
Nope.

255
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,970
有里欧或桑托斯的消息吗
Has anybody heard from Leo or Santos?

256
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,420
最后一次有人在蒙特卡洛
Last time anyone saw them,

257
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,810
去赌场的路上见过他们
they were hitting up the casinos in Monte Carlo.

258
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,970
我以为那就是最后一单生意  布莱恩
I thought that was our last job, Brian.

259
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,690
这些装备谁来买单  纳税人吗
And who's paying for all this equipment? The taxpayers?

260
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,600
于是我们现在为绿巨人卖命吗  是这样吗
So now we work for The Hulk? That's what we're doing?

261
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,570
我怎么闻到婴儿霜的味道
Why do I smell baby oil?

262
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,110
你要是再不闭上你的臭嘴
If you keep running your piehole,

263
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,490
就会闻到屁股开花的味道
you're going to smell an ass- kicking.

264
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,700
霍布斯
All right, Hobbs,

265
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,530
世界上最优秀的队伍
you got the best crew in the world

266
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,990
就在这里
standing right in front of you.

267
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,030
给他们一个留下的理由
Give them a reason to stay.

268
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,000
我们的目标是欧文・肖
Our target is Owen Shaw.

269
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,330
前英国空军特勤队少校  黑色行动成员
Former major in the S.A.S., Spec- ops soldier.

270
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,170
他曾掌控喀布尔和波斯尼亚的英国空中机动处
He ran the UK's Mobility Division in Kabul and Basra.

271
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,010
真该死  这可不是盖的
Ah, damn. That Mobility unit's the truth.

272
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,300
这可是战争载具  他们是世界一流的
We're talking vehicular warfare. Best in the world.

273
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,550
-要点薯片吗  -他们可不是等闲之辈
- You got some chips? - Those guys don't mess around.

274
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,680
多年来  他们一直在欧洲作案
For years, they've been running jobs in Europe,

275
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,140
最近几桩生意
but it's their most recent jobs

276
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,480
让他们名声大噪
that graduated them to a whole new level.

277
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,020
他们袭击了三个特定目标
Three targets, highly specific.

278
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,690
一个是洲际弹道导弹的编程终端
The program terminal from an ICBM missile...

279
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,990
有零钱吗
Got a little change?

280
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,700
开什么玩笑
Seriously? You're a millionaire,

281
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,700
你这样的百万富翁还问别人要钱?
and you're still trying to ask for money?

282
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,700
这就是为什么你只是百万富翁
That's how you stay a millionaire.

283
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,040
这都是怎么回事
So what does this all mean?

284
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,700
最可能是肖的队伍
Well, our best guess is that Shaw's crew

285
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,830
正在建造某种暗影系统
is building a Nightshade device.

286
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,670
-什么系统  -一种科技炸弹
- Which is? - A tech bomb.

287
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,340
能使整个军方通讯电网
Designed to block an entire military communication grid

288
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,710
瘫痪24小时
for 24 hours.

289
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,550
战斗中哪怕只有一秒分神
If you blind a soldier for a single second

290
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,260
也能因此丧命
in the middle of a fight, he dies.

291
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,220
整个国家的通讯被切断24小时
If you blind a country for 24 hours,

292
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,680
所造成的伤亡根本无法想象
the loss of life is unthinkable.

293
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,720
在懂行的买家眼里这东西值几十亿
This could be worth billions to the right buyer.

294
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,850
有几十亿?
Billions?

295
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,640
我们干脆偷回来得了
Why don't we just steal that shit?

296
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,730
伙计
Hey, man.

297
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,310
哪个是一块钱
Which one of these things is a dollar?

298
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,190
这里写着...
It says something about...

299
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,160
我请客
It's on the house.

300
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,830
我需要你们帮我捉到肖
I want you to help me catch Shaw.

301
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,370
他还缺最后一件
He's only got one piece left that he needs,

302
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,380
我们要在他到手前阻止他
and I intend to stop him before he gets it.

303
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,590
我知道你们像亲人一样
Now, I know you guys are a family.

304
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,260
现在我就给你们一个机会
So I'm offering you a chance right now

305
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,340
让这个家庭再次团圆
to make that family whole again.

306
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,520
你想让我们再次团圆吗
You want to make this family whole again?

307
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,600
带我们找拉蒂  我们会捉住肖
Get us to Letty, we'll get you Shaw,

308
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,440
之前的案底一笔勾销
full pardons all the way around.

309
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,700
这个我保证不了
I can't promise you that.

310
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,360
你可以
Yes, you can.

311
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,120
这就是条件
That's the deal.

312
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,620
接不接受随你
Take it or leave it.

313
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,710
你们捉到肖
You get me Shaw,

314
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,760
我就给你们豁免
and I'll get your pardons.

315
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,760
你们都听到了
You heard him.

316
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,470
但这次不一样
But this is different.

317
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,810
我们不是对付条子
We're not dealing with cops,

318
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,140
也不是对付毒贩
we're not dealing with drug dealers.

319
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,350
根本不是一个级别
This is a whole different level.

320
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,400
这活有报酬吧
We're getting paid, right?

321
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
把衣服掀起来
Lift your shirt.

322
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,500
国际刑警在莫斯科逮到一个肖的手下
Interpol picked up one of Shaw's guys in Moscow.

323
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,500
我对他进行了心理辅导
I went in, had a little therapy session with him.

324
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,960
他供出了肖的藏身之处
He gave up Shaw's hideout.

325
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,840
那我们为什么不行动
Then why aren't we down there now?

326
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,840
人家没邀请我们
Well, we weren't invited.

327
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,910
霍布斯  诱饵已经放回去了
Hobbs, they're sending in your punching bag.

328
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,790
他带着通讯设备
He's wired.

329
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,020
他们行动之前先确定里面那个是不是肖
He's going to give a positive ID on Shaw before they move in.

330
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,200
条子就这么把你放了?
So, the cops just let you go, huh?

331
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,870
别担心  我什么都没说
Don't worry, I didn't give them shit.

332
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,040
我不是担心
Oh, I'm not worried.

333
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,120
好了
Okay,

334
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,380
帮我启动它
turn it over for me.

335
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,720
行了
God, it's amazing.

336
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,270
最简单的东西也能引发最大的问题
The simplest things can cause the biggest problems.

337
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,900
但好消息是  把坏的部分换掉
Good news is, if you swap out a bad part,

338
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,320
一切还是完美无瑕
everything runs smooth as silk again.

339
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
听着  肖
Look, Shaw.

340
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,360
等等
Wait, Shaw! Shaw!

341
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,070
肖
Shaw!

342
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,070
语音匹配  欧文・肖

343
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,580
确认是肖无误  让他们行动吧
I just got confirmation on Shaw. They're going in.

344
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,390
等等  慢着  慢着
Wait, wait, hold up...

345
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,590
警用扫描设备显示
Police scanners are saying

346
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,430
国际刑警总部遭侵入
alarms are going off at Interpol headquarters.

347
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,560
该死
Shit.

348
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,890
他引开我们  好去对付国际刑警
He brought us here so he could take down Interpol.

349
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,400
这一切都是个陷阱
This whole thing's a set-up.

350
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,520
-布莱恩  你带队走  -你呢
- Brian, take the team. - What about you?

351
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,860
霍布斯和我等着肖
Hobbs and I will wait for Shaw.

352
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,780
肖能带我们找到拉蒂
Shaw leads to Letty.

353
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,950
快出来  王八蛋
Come on, you son of a bitch.

354
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,290
这是什么
What's this?

355
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,420
上次干活的报酬
It's your share from the last job.

356
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,630
你也是一份子  奥克斯
You're part of the team, Oakes.

357
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
干了活当然有报酬
You do your job, you get paid.

358
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,270
里面还有点额外奖励
There's a little extra in there for you.

359
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,310
就当是预支吧
Consider it an advance.

360
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,690
预支什么
For what?

361
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,980
预支下次任务的报酬
The next job, of course.

362
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,980
什么任务
Which job?

363
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,860
我们现在做的这个
The one we're working right now.

364
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,620
汉  离国际刑警总部还有多远
Han, how far are we from Interpol?

365
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,990
还有两个街口
Twelve blocks away.

366
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,580
伙计们  这里跟座鬼城一样
You guys, it's a ghost town over here.

367
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,250
肖把所有条子都引到那边去了
Shaw must have pulled all the cops to him.

368
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,420
游戏该结束了  干掉他们
All right, y'all, we're in this shit, so let's go get it.

369
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,170
跟你赛车很愉快  伙计
It's been fun running with you, mate.

370
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,850
把包扔掉
Stop! Drop the bag!

371
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,100
-他来了  -收到
- There he is. - On it.

372
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,690
托雷多  在你前面  别跟丢了
Toretto, it's on you. Straight ahead, don't lose him.

373
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,860
绝对不会
Ain't gonna happen.

374
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,630
抱歉  伙计们
Sorry about that, boys.

375
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,140
国际刑警总部就在前面了
Interpol, straight ahead.

376
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,610
兄弟们  有贵客上门了
Let's go, guys. We've got company.

377
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,500
行动  兄弟们
Let's go, boys.

378
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,260
我们上
Get in! Let's go!

379
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,020
我们得行动  快
Hey! We got to move. Now!

380
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,630
肖  有三辆车尾随我们
Shaw, we have three cars tailing us.

381
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,700
你知道该怎么做
You know what to do.

382
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,700
准备好芯片干扰  快点

383
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,710
我来应付这辆路虎
Guys, I got the Rover.

384
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,550
好  那我来应付...
Okay, I got...

385
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,090
这个叫不上名的鬼东西
Whatever the hell that thing is.

386
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
那是什么  冰球吗
What is that, a hockey puck?

387
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,880
打中了

388
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,180
一号芯片已就绪

389
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,180
该死
Oh! Shit!

390
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,180
最后一台芯片就位

391
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,180
没用  没用

392
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,290
正在接近目标位置
Approaching rendezvous point.

393
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,340
唐  泰吉和罗曼被撞翻了  你在哪
Dom! Tej and Roman are out! Where you at?

394
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,640
我就在你后面
I'm right behind you!

395
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,660
快到了  我要放手一搏
Stay on track. I'm taking the contingency.

396
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,500
大伙  我盯住肖了  他刚刚左转
Boys, I got eyes on Shaw. He just made a left.

397
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,670
-我去右边  -托雷多  左转
- I got right. - Toretto, make that left!

398
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,670
玮

399
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,670
我需要你的帮助

400
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,840
没问题
No problem.

401
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,330
拉蒂
Letty.

402
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,930
你来驾驶
Take the wheel.

403
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,050
拉蒂
Letty.

404
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,650
真是疯了
This is crazy.

405
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,410
我们又不是在巴西
We are not in Brazil.

406
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,990
你们居然玩起了空中飞车?
So, now we got cars flying in the air?

407
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,250
还是在拍007吗  我们不能这样做
On some 007- type shit? This is not what we do!

408
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,750
伙计  你该去做心理检查了
Man, you really got to check that emotion.

409
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,670
你的公鸭嗓都变成狗狗音了
Your voice just went from Shaggy to Scooby- Doo.

410
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,500
"我们不能...汪汪汪"
"This is not what we..."

411
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,920
当一个女人冲你开枪时
See, man, when a woman starts shooting at you,

412
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,840
你就该夹起尾巴开溜
that's a clear sign to back the fuck off!

413
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,390
我们不能再这样下去了
We need to get the hell out of Dodge!

414
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:00,180
如果打中我脑门怎么办  伙计
That could have been my forehead, man.

415
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,600
不会
No.

416
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,850
你脑门比这大多了
That's not as big as your forehead.

417
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,860
米娅
Mia.

418
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,700
是拉蒂没错
Uh, It's definitely Letty.

419
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,910
但情况很复杂
But it's, uh.. It's complicated.

420
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,700
拉蒂还活着
Letty's alive.

421
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,870
这才是最重要的
That's all that matters.

422
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,670
我们都支持她  布莱恩
We have her back, Brian.

423
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,340
帮我给杰克一个晚安吻吧
Well, do me a favor and give Jack a kiss goodnight for me.

424
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,720
-一定要平安  -我爱你  米娅
- Be safe. - I love you, Mia.

425
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,820
她看清楚是你了吗
She definitely saw it was you?

426
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,650
她直盯着我  布莱恩
She looked dead at me, Brian.

427
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,490
也许我们认识的拉蒂已经消失了  唐
Maybe the Letty we once knew is gone, Dom.

428
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,910
就算她还活着  也不是原来的她了
Even though she's alive, maybe she's gone.

429
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,750
我们不能跟亲人反目
You don't turn your back on family.

430
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,090
即使他们这样做了
Even when they do.

431
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,270
-艾维  -在
- Ivory. - Yo.

432
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,940
这辆车需要修理
It's going to need some repairs.

433
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,940
没问题  甜心
No problem, treacle.

434
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,030
你没事吧
Are you good?

435
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,910
没事
Yeah.

436
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,120
好了  全体注意
Okay, listen up.

437
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,120
这次跟霍布斯以往那些喽不一样
That was a very different breed from Hobbs' usual wannabe warriors.

438
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,960
来看看他们是什么来头  都有什么本事
We need to learn who these people are, what they're made of.

439
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,090
玮
Vegh?

440
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,630
奥康纳  帕克
O'Conner, Parker,

441
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,220
皮尔斯  托雷多
Pearce, Toretto

442
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,600
加上其他队员
and the rest of the team.

443
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,140
这群人都是普通罪犯而已
These guys are common criminals.

444
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,310
就是这群普通罪犯
Tonight these common criminals were seconds away

445
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,770
差点将我们打败
from taking us down.

446
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,110
给他们应有的尊重  不然骄兵必败
Show them the respect they deserve, or it weakens us.

447
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,490
你该看看这个
You might want to see this.

448
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,950
能想起什么来吗
Ring any bells?

449
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,960
是的
Yeah.

450
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,550
这就是我打伤的那个人
That's the guy I shot.

451
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,760
照片里你挺开心的
You look happy.

452
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,260
我不记得他了
I don't remember him.

453
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,680
简直胡说八道
That's bullshit.

454
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,510
我们有麻烦了  伙计们
We got a problem, guys.

455
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,350
跟她合影的那个男人差点就把你拉下马
We got a picture of her with the guy who almost took you out.

456
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,310
克劳斯  你不是肌肉男吗
Klaus, aren't you team muscle?

457
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,060
别逼我不讲情面  把你变成娘炮
Don't make me go over there and make you team pussy.

458
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,360
她不记得他了
She doesn't remember him.

459
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,190
光有名字和档案还不够
Names and records aren't enough.

460
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,160
我需要私人信息
I want personal information.

461
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,660
生活琐事  他们的所思所想
Get into their lives, into their minds.

462
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,660
一旦找到弱点  就能将他们一举击溃
Find their weaknesses, and we will exploit them.

463
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,250
好极了
Mmm- hmm. Yeah, right.

464
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,210
这也太疯狂了  伙计
This is crazy, man.

465
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,880
你又在嘟囔什么
What are you talking about now?

466
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,630
我在这里查看这些图片
I'm sitting here looking at these images,

467
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,510
就好象要追捕邪恶版本的自己一样
it's like we're hunting our evil twins.

468
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,220
看看这个小黑哥  他真帅
Look at this black dude right here, he's handsome.

469
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,720
简直是我的影子
Clearly, that's me.

470
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,730
还有白版霍布斯  这是汉
We got a white Hobbs. This is Han.

471
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,400
这个是泰吉  还带着非洲小帽
Tej, it's an African in a beanie.

472
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,690
就像你的迷你版本
That's like your Mini- Me, man.

473
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,150
布莱恩
And Brian!

474
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,490
你什么时候拍的这写真
When did you do this photo shoot?

475
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,240
我逗逗你而已
I'm just playing, man.

476
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,870
你是这里最美的金发妞
You know you're the prettiest blonde around here.

477
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,920
都给我精神点  两件事要说
All right, lock it up. We got two things.

478
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:58,710
第一
First off,

479
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,220
这城市是罪犯的噩梦
this is the worst damn city in the world to commit a crime.

480
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,050
每个街角都有监控摄像头
They got cameras on every street corner.

481
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,550
这是闭路电视带子
I got video footage from CCTV of the raid.

482
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,760
看看我们能不能发现什么
Let's track that, see where it leads us.

483
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:07,700
第二
And secondly,

484
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,270
我们知道了肖的团伙抢了什么
we just got confirmation on what Shaw's crew grabbed from Interpol.

485
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,600
他们黑了一个数据库
They ripped off the database

486
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,600
里面有他们要的东西存放的地点
of every location that houses the final component that they need.

487
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,770
在哪里
So where are they at?

488
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,610
在欧洲一共有20多个
There are over two dozen of them around Europe.

489
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,900
这列表有效期只有96小时
But the list is only good for 96 hours.

490
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,030
这意味着  不管他们目标是什么
Which means, wherever Shaw's crew is going to hit next,

491
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,030
他们一定在四天内动手
it's going to happen within the next four days.

492
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,450
他们有目标了  我们也一样
They got a window, and so do we.

493
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,240
-动手吧  -霍布斯说的对
- We gotta move. - Hobbs is right.

494
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,790
我们来分析一下
So let's break this down.

495
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,000
大干一场吧  我们有什么情报
You met them. What do we know?

496
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,160
他们一定在用自己订制的引擎
We know they have to be running custom engines.

497
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,080
你也听到那车换档的声音了
You heard that flip car going through those gears.

498
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,460
顺序式变速箱
Sequential transmission.

499
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,960
那引擎听起来可不一般
That didn't sound like a normal engine.

500
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,750
柴油涡轮增压引擎
That was a turbo diesel.

501
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,130
它听起来是从勒芒[法国城市]来的
It sounded like something you hear at Le Mans.

502
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,300
就算被撞
Did you see it take all those hits

503
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,590
那车也能保持平稳
and still stay flat in the corners?

504
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,800
没错  液压稳定装置
Yeah, hydraulics.

505
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,090
还有磁悬浮悬挂
Or magnetic suspension.

506
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,430
想想有谁能接触到那些零件
Who not only has access to the components,

507
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,810
还能改造它们
but can fabricate something like that?

508
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,770
伦敦有很多店可以
Maybe a handful of shops in London.

509
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,520
普通的店可不敢做
Regular tuner shops aren't going to cut it on this one.

510
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,520
我们得深挖一下线索
We're going to have to dig deeper than that.

511
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,150
汉  吉赛尔和罗曼  你们上
Han, Gisele, Roman, you're up.

512
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,150
我们只要找到造那辆车的人
We find the guy who made that car,

513
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,740
就能找到肖
we find Shaw.

514
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,450
走吧
Let's go.

515
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,620
-我也来帮忙  -没问题
- I'll help. - Roger that.

516
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,040
泰吉
Tej,

517
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,580
我们需要不带芯片的车子
we're gonna need cars without computer chips that can be overridden.

518
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,460
必须快到极致
Make sure they're fast.

519
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,000
看我的吧
I got this.

520
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,330
已经在办了  唐
I'm already on it, Dom.

521
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,790
我联系了皇家海军和外交安全局
I've contacted R&D at DSS.

522
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,420
霍布斯
Hobbs.

523
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,210
我说了就看我的吧
I said I got this.

524
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,680
越来越有趣了
This should be interesting.

525
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,690
伙计  你得放轻松点
Man, you really got to loosen up.

526
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,890
就弄些工厂出的普通货色
You can't just throw a bunch

527
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,610
这些行家可不会满意
of factory- line Beemers at people and expect...

528
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,360
这可是一辆牛车啊
Hey. That car is a hell of a car.

529
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,280
双涡轮增压V8引擎
You're talking about twin- turbo V8,

530
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,370
足有560匹马力呢
spitting out 560 ponies, son.

531
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,120
做了不少功课啊  真替你感到骄傲
He reads the brochure. I'm proud.

532
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,080
但只有订制的车子才最牛
But with cars, you have to customize.

533
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,370
在你和车之间
It's all between you and the car you build.

534
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,130
必须有一种联系  一种承诺
It's a bond, it's a commitment.

535
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,920
听起来和结婚没两样
It sounds like a marriage.

536
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,710
但你和车子分手时
Yeah, but with cars, when you trade up,

537
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,880
它们不会分你一半财产
they don't take half your shit.

538
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,050
老天爷
Jesus.

539
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,470
看这价位  车子肯定是黄金打造
With price tags like this, these cars better be made out of gold.

540
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,810
你不会在考虑偷这些车吧  帕克
You ain't thinking about stealing these cars, are you, Parker?

541
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,690
帮厨的入口在后面
Kitchen help entrance is towards the back.

542
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:21,820
你说什么
Come again?

543
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,230
无意冒犯
I don't mean any offense, gentlemen,

544
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,070
不过你们可买不起这些车
but you couldn't possibly afford the cars in this auction.

545
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,410
全身没带点珠宝  也没点贵族气息
Substantial lack of gaudy jewelry, no entourage, no honeys.

546
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,620
明显  你也不是个舞伴
Clearly you're not a "Baller."

547
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,990
还有你
And you.

548
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,080
不管是鞋子衬衣还是裤子
Hmm. Shoes, shirt, trousers.

549
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,580
都是休闲的
Functional.

550
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,750
身姿又很僵硬
And your posture, too rigid, no swagger.

551
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,380
估计是个5万块钱一年的大兵哥
My guess is military. Take home of 50,000 a year.

552
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,170
我说的可是美元
That's U.S.

553
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,550
肯定不够你来这儿花销了
Which is not enough to be playing here.

554
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,380
你们要不是帮厨
So, if you're not kitchen help,

555
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,470
那肯定是来错地方了
then you must be in the wrong place.

556
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,060
不过呢  喝完这杯再走人吧
But please, do finish your champagne.

557
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,230
得给他点教训才行
Oh, he needs to be taught a lesson.

558
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,310
我说过了  你不可以偷这些车
Like I said, you ain't stealing these cars.

559
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,940
我知道啦
I got this.

560
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,780
到了  这就是列表上的5号
All right, this is number five on our list.

561
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,290
我的老天爷
Holy shit.

562
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,710
那伙计要猎杀什么啊  大白鲸吗
What's the dude plan on hunting? Moby Dick?

563
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,420
是他没错了
That must be our guy.

564
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,710
你们准备怎么下手
So, how do you all want to play this?

565
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,880
我和汉就能搞定
Han and I got this.

566
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:32,470
我们俩下去  让我来搞定一切
We go in tight, you let me do all the talking,

567
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,850
你们站后面看就行了
and you all have my back on it.

568
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,390
你俩老爷们忘了一件事
There's one thing you boys are forgetting.

569
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,140
他终归是个男人
He's a man.

570
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,730
我们上
Let's go.

571
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,310
他是个男人
"He's a man"?

572
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,150
她总是这么说
You know, she always says that.

573
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,570
你手里的是5.45乘18口径
What you're looking at is a 5.45

574
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,830
FMJ全金属弹头子弹
by 18 FMJ spitzer bullet.

575
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,000
是手枪专用子弹  PSM手枪
It's specific to one handgun, the PSM.

576
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,830
事实上  私持手枪在英国是违法的
Given that handguns are illegal in the United Kingdom,

577
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,670
只有少数人可以持有那样的枪械
there's very few people that have access to that firearm.

578
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,340
既然是这样
So if somebody wanted to, say,

579
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,510
追查枪的来源
track down where it came from,

580
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,840
不会太困难
it wouldn't be too hard.

581
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,800
当警察那么久  老习惯还是改不了
I was a cop for a lot of years. Some habits die hard.

582
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,810
典当铺
A pawn shop.

583
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,280
谁介绍你们来的
Who sent you?

584
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,780
说吧  美人儿
Come on, ladies!

585
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,370
一般像你俩这种美人儿来我这
Two hot girls like you don't wander into this neighborhood

586
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,290
我都会先打个电话给你们妈咪的
unless l've called the escort service.

587
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,330
今天不打电话竟然自动上门了
And l haven't, yet, today.

588
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,850
她们行吗  我可不看好
I don't know, man. That was disrespectful.

589
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,430
我也不喜欢她的语气
And I don't like the way she said it,

590
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,350
他终归是个男人
like, "He's a man."

591
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,440
他是个男人  那我们算什么
"He's a man"? So, what are we?

592
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,150
算了  她只是为了任务
Come on, she's just doing her job.

593
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,110
什么为了任务
"Doing her job."

594
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,910
我算看明白了
I see what's going on.

595
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,950
看明白什么
See what?

596
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,200
你八成爱上她了吧
You got the little stardust in your eyes, eh?

597
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,620
爱情鸟在脑袋周围转圈
Little birds floating around a little bit.

598
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,710
合伙做任务不够  你还想纳她入后宫
Uh, you don't want to lease this model. You want to buy.

599
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,050
你可以闭嘴了
Can you please stop talking?

600
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:21,130
你坠入爱河啦  看看你的样子
No, no, you're in love! Look at you!

601
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,640
快闭嘴吧
Just stop.

602
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,310
有没有制定泡妞计划  来个美妙约会
You got special plans? Big day?

603
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,960
把我们都请来
You're going to invite us all out?

604
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,730
你可得买颗大点的钻石
Better make sure you get her a big rock, man,

605
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,890
她可没那么容易被驯服
'cause she doesn't look like she'll be that easily impressed.

606
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,150
要是钻石不大
And if it's not a big rock,

607
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,310
那玩意儿大也行呀
you better be big somewhere else.

608
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,770
你懂的
You know what I'm talking about.

609
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,320
所以你马子才带那么多首饰是吧
That's why all your girlfriends wear so much bling, huh?

610
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,990
我们需要点情报
We're looking for information.

611
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,200
你们需要情报? 有关什么的
You're looking for information? About what?

612
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,370
当然是有关车子的
Information about cars.

613
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,580
尤其是你最近设计的两辆
In particular, two you designed recently.

614
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,500
道奇公羊  低底盘  车颈框架
Ramp cars. Low slung, skeletal frames.

615
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:59,050
我们对买那些车的人很感兴趣
We'd be very interested to find the man who bought those.

616
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,170
我为什么要帮你们
Why should I help you?

617
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,590
因为我们真诚相求了
Because we're asking you nicely.

618
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,050
就因为真诚相求吗
Because you're asking me nicely?

619
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,010
那就看你有什么特殊的本事了
What can you offer that I can't get from a thousand other girls?

620
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,310
住手  住手啊
Stop! Stop!

621
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,200
你看上去挺能抗
You look like a man who likes it rough.

622
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:27,120
我的这位朋友可以给你最剧烈的疼痛
My friend here can give you heights of pain

623
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,990
我敢肯定你以前从未体验过
you've never experienced before.

624
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,040
想做交易了吗
Do we have a deal?

625
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,670
我做  我做
Deal! Deal! Deal!

626
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,920
我收回刚才的话
I take it back.

627
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,960
我也爱这小妞
Me likey.

628
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,020
好了  好了  停
Stop, stop, stop.

629
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,730
这就是你的方法吗  把它们全买下来
So this is how you "Got this"? By buying all of his cars?

630
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,900
钱都烂在银行的话
What good is having millions of dollars in the bank

631
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,400
人生就没有意义了
if you don't spend any of it?

632
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,400
别担心  看我的
But don't worry about that. Watch this.

633
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:08,530
帕克先生  请允许我再一次表达谢意
Mr. Parker, again, can I just express our gratitude

634
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,040
非常感谢您带来的生意
and say how much we appreciate your business.

635
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,830
如果您还有任何需要  请尽管提出要求
If there's ever anything else you need, you just have to ask.

636
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:14,960
任何需要吗
Anything?

637
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,750
既然你这么说了
Now that you mention it, my swagger- less friend here,

638
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,550
我的朋友很中意你的衬衫
he really likes that shirt you have on.

639
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,670
身上这件吗
Uh, this shirt?

640
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,090
就是那件
That shirt.

641
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,090
这么小他恐怕穿不下吧
I'm not entirely sure that this shirt would fit your friend.

642
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,260
我穿的下
It will fit.

643
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,010
他需要一件不那么
He needs a shirt that's a little less...

644
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,180
休闲的衬衫
Functional.

645
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,930
没错  太休闲了
That's it, functional.

646
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,560
好吧
Okay.

647
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,110
-我来拿着  -谢谢
- I'll hold that. - Thank you.

648
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,900
赶紧的  时间就是金钱
Come on, man, time is money.

649
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,160
我正尽力呢
Yes, doing my best.

650
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,950
靠  老兄你该褪褪毛了吧
Damn, you need some hedge clippers for that shit.

651
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:56,620
这下您满意了吧
Well, if that will be all...

652
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,670
裤子也脱了
And the pants, too.

653
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,130
当然了
Right.

654
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,090
把那手表也那来吧
While you're at it, let me get that watch.

655
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,390
我喜欢那块表
I like that watch.

656
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,020
这条是您的
This is for you.

657
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:25,150
-这块是您的  -谢谢
- And this is for you. - Thank you.

658
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:27,990
祝愉快  谢谢
Good day, gentlemen. Thank you.

659
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,750
我把资料放这里了
So I, um, I got the information in here.

660
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,550
能问一下你们找肖做什么吗
May I ask why you're looking for Shaw?

661
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,350
他拿了我们的东西
He took something of ours.

662
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,140
我们得和他谈谈
We'd like to talk to him about it.

663
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,310
看看我们能找到什么吧
Let's see what we've got.

664
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,160
小子  你想怎样
All right. What do you want?

665
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,460
我们要找一把俄罗斯的枪
They say if someone's looking for a Russian gun,

666
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,870
大家说可以找你
you're the man to see.

667
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,290
是这样没错
Oh, they do, do they?

668
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,840
找麻烦吗  伙计
What do you want, mate?

669
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,100
想死就进来
That might be a bad idea.

670
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,400
-我在找这个的主人  -我不知道
- I'm looking for the owner of this. - I don't know.

671
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,780
看看仔细再说
Take a closer look.

672
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,910
大概一星期前
About a week ago, a girl came in,

673
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,410
一个女孩来买走了所有东西
bought guns, ammo, everything I had.

674
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,160
一个女孩吗
A girl?

675
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,700
她长什么样
What did she look like?

676
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,200
瘦脸颊  深色头发
Tough chick, dark hair.

677
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:59,870
身材消瘦
Mean streak.

678
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,290
据说是个赛车手
Word is she's a street racer.

679
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,460
去哪能找到她
Where can we find her?

680
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,210
我怎么知道  我看起来像赛车手吗
How do I know? Do I look like a racer?

681
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,260
你确实不像
No. You don't.

682
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,680
伙计们保重
Take care, guys.

683
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:27,190
该死
Oh, shit.

684
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,040
抱歉了女士们
Sorry, girls.

685
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,670
快走
Let's go!

686
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:41,060
坚持住
Hold on.

687
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,980
保持清醒
Stay with me. Stay with me.

688
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,480
告诉我如何找到肖
Tell me where to find Shaw,

689
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,560
我会让他付出代价
and I'll make him pay for this.

690
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,360
布拉加
Braga...

691
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,540
喂  叫你呢
Hey, you!

692
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:50,750
站住别动
Stop right there!

693
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,750
-上  -不  还是你上
- Go! - No! You go!

694
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:47,170
这事谁也不能知道
No one needs to know about this.

695
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,170
谁都不行
No one.

696
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:05,560
我们失去了艾维
We lost Ivory.

697
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,270
他死了
He's gone.

698
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,020
谢了
Thanks.

699
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,280
你就说这些吗
That's it?

700
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:18,700
如果艾维死了  那说明他犯了个错
If Ivory's dead, he made a mistake.

701
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,370
一旦犯了错误  就要付出代价
If you make a mistake, you pay the price.

702
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,210
你真是说得一口好悼词  肖
That's a great eulogy, Shaw.

703
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,090
我们下次再外出行动时
Are you going to give the same speech

704
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,960
你也打算这么说吗
for the rest of us when we go out?

705
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,820
我没想到你会这么多愁善感
You're the last one I'd have pegged to be sentimental.

706
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,080
我喜欢你  拉蒂
I like you, Letty.

707
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,700
甚至呆在你身边都让我觉得很温暖
I dare say I even feel a certain warmth towards you.

708
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,250
当我在医院
When I found you in the hospital,

709
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:09,790
发现失去记忆的你时
and you couldn't remember anything,

710
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,090
我告诉自己
I said to myself,

711
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,300
这个女孩天赋异禀
"This girl has a gift.

712
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,720
她就像一张白纸
"She's a blank page."

713
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,470
这激起了我对你的保护欲
And that made me feel somewhat protective toward you.

714
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,810
如果你出了什么事
If something happened to you, for instance,

715
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:32,150
我会难以承受
I think I might find that slightly harder to bear.

716
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,150
我想说的是
What I'm saying is,

717
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,950
我不想看到你
I would hate to see you

718
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,330
犯那种错误
make a mistake.

719
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,420
我去透透气
I'm going to get some air.

720
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,320
-怎么了  -我们见过唐的女友了
- What the hell happened? - We met Dom's girlfriend.

721
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,780
她挺可爱的
She's lovely.

722
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,830
-你没事吧  -没事
- Are you all right? - Yeah.

723
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:29,250
伙计们  查看监控系统有什么进展吗
Tej, what have you got? Footage, CCTV? Talk to me.

724
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:30,960
全部的监控录像我都看过了
I just went through all of it.

725
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:31,870
你敢信吗
Believe it or not,

726
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,880
肖的团队出现过的地方摄像头都坏了
everywhere Shaw's team is, the cameras are down.

727
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,960
是巧合吗
That's a hell of a coincidence.

728
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,840
看来我们得去查看一下监控中心  走吧
All right, we're going to pay CCTV a little visit. Let's roll.

729
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,630
这是什么
What is that?

730
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,180
那是给你带回来的新玩意
That is a new toy for you.

731
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,510
到底发生了什么
So, what happened?

732
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,270
肖的人突然出现  拿着枪乱扫
Shaw's goons showed up and started shooting up the place.

733
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,730
但我们拿到了好东西
But we got something big.

734
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,390
-是什么  -布拉加
- What? - Braga.

735
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,730
他和肖是合作关系
He's working with Shaw.

736
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,400
你这话是什么意思
What are you talking about?

737
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,320
她说的对  那人手机上的交易支付记录
It's true. That phone's filled with coded payment transactions

738
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:02,320
都直指布拉加的贩毒集团
that lead straight to Braga's cartel.

739
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:03,990
那个布拉加是谁
Who the hell is Braga?

740
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,990
他是墨西哥最大的毒枭之一
He ran one of the biggest cartels in Mexico.

741
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,450
我曾经为他卖过命
And my old boss.

742
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,000
我们也曾用他们那种密码
We used codes just like that

743
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,160
把钱转移出国
to move money out of the country.

744
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,420
这能说的通
It all makes sense.

745
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,130
拉蒂曾被布拉加追杀  如今是肖的手下
Braga was running Letty, now he's working with Shaw.

746
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,630
布拉加和肖就是这么认识的
It would explain how the two of them met.

747
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,550
你们信息很全面
Okay, so you all know all this information about him,

748
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,340
但我们要怎么找到他
where do we find him?

749
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,340
他在洛杉矶蹲监狱呢
He's sitting in a prison in Los Angeles.

750
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,760
你怎么知道的
How do you know that?

751
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,890
是布莱恩把他关进去的
Brian put him there.

752
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,810
他现在就是我们的突破口
All right, so this is the break we were looking for.

753
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:32,270
既然他们在合作
If the two of them were working together,

754
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,850
那布拉加一定知道肖的企图
Braga will know what Shaw's up to.

755
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,230
我去拜访他一下
I'm going to pay him a visit.

756
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,940
你别开玩笑了
Are you serious right now?

757
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,480
用脑子好好想想你刚刚说的话
Think about what you're saying.

758
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,280
你现在是通缉犯  布莱恩
You're wanted, Brian.

759
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:45,360
你只要一踏上美国就会被判刑
The moment you step foot off that plane, it's a wrap.

760
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,950
你就回不来了
You're not coming back.

761
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,540
别说回不来了  你怎样才能进入美国
"Coming back"? How are you going to get in the country?

762
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,580
这个不是问题
Let me worry about that.

763
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:00,880
这是我的责任
This is on me.

764
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,260
是我把布拉加抓进去的
I'm the one that served her up to Braga.

765
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,220
所以我要把这事办好
I'm the one that gets to make it right.

766
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,560
我一定会成功的
Let me make it right.

767
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:16,020
注意安全
Be careful.

768
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,950
他现在可以见你了  这边请
He's ready to see you now. Right this way.

769
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,770
谢谢你能见我们
Thank you for seeing us.

770
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:31,200
这不会耽搁你太长时间
I won't take up much of your time.

771
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:33,000
我的手下今天早些时候遭到攻击
My men were attacked earlier today.

772
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,500
我要查看一下在滑铁卢车站内
I'm going to need to see all cameras

773
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,080
和其周边的监控录像
in and around Waterloo station.

774
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:41,670
谁来告诉这位美国队长这是需要被批准的
Will somebody tell Captain America here that requires clearance?

775
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,260
特里
Terry,

776
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:51,600
把58至62号摄像机早些的录像调出来
bring up cameras 58 through 62, earlier today.

777
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,690
这些摄像机由于维修今晨全部关闭了
They've been down for maintenance all morning.

778
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,520
抱歉了
Sorry.

779
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:02,020
好吧  那算了  感谢你的帮助
Okay. Well, we appreciate your help. Thank you.

780
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,530
我发现了一个十分有趣的事
You know what I find very interesting

781
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,490
国际刑警总部最近也发生了攻击事件
is Interpol was attacked recently as well.

782
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,870
那里的摄像机也坏了  什么都没拍到
Those cameras were down, too. Didn't catch a thing.

783
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,330
什么也没有
Nothing.

784
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,290
也就是说  要么是
Now, that means either

785
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,960
你们的维修时间
your maintenance schedule lines up

786
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,290
和案件出奇的同步
perfectly with their escape route

787
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,050
要么就是你们这有内奸
or it's someone here that's working with them.

788
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,880
不过这事也太扯了
And that's just ridiculous.

789
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,130
因为说到你们这有内奸的话
Because there ain't no way in hell

790
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,680
那是不可能的
anybody here would be working for them.

791
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,300
更不会是你  对吧
Particularly you, ain't that right?

792
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:33,510
不  这太扯了
No, no, that's ridiculous.

793
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,140
是啊  的确很扯
That is ridiculous.

794
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:38,100
我要获取你的所有监控信号
I'm going to need direct access to your live feed

795
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,230
要全市范围的
citywide.

796
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:42,570
我强烈建议你这次
And I also strongly suggest that you put a hold on any more

797
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:43,820
暂停你们的维修工作
"Maintenance."

798
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,860
没问题
Yeah, of course.

799
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,400
十分感谢你的帮助
We appreciate your help. Thank you so much.

800
00:56:54,970 --> 00:57:03,690
洛杉矶

801
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:09,470
看啊看啊
Well, well, well.

802
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,800
你穿橘色很适合啊
The orange in that really makes your eyes pop.

803
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,350
谢了  伙计们
Thanks, fellas.

804
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,150
和我说说  奥康纳
Tell me something, O'Conner,

805
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,230
你满世界逃窜
how is it you keep running around the world,

806
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,440
不断寻找法律的漏洞  可是
breaking every law known to man,

807
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,400
为什么我现在把你抓住了呢
and yet here I am, putting my job on the line for you?

808
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:29,580
如果我把抓住肖
You'll feel a lot better

809
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,410
归功于你怎么样
once you get the credit for taking down Shaw.

810
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,280
抓住你我已经很满意了
Oh, I'm tempted to settle for you.

811
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:37,080
你知道吗  斯塔夏克
Well, you know what they say, Stasiak,

812
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,700
你要是想抓个大人物
if you want the career- changing big fish,

813
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:40,540
你就该懂得
you got to be willing to put on the big boy panties

814
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,670
舍不得孩子套不着狼的道理
and sail out to the deep water.

815
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,210
你就是个混蛋
You're an asshole, you know that?

816
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:51,970
我想死你了伙计  真的
I missed you, too, man. I really missed you.

817
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,730
我给你做的假身份
I got you admitted

818
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,510
能让你做你该做的事
into Victorville to do whatever you got to do.

819
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,270
24小时拘留
It's a 24- hour hold.

820
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:00,100
明天9点你前必须逃出去
You need to be out of there by 9:00 a.M.

821
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:01,550
你的指纹
That's when Forensics will run

822
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:03,600
会被输入国家指纹库
your fingerprints through the national database.

823
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,520
指纹库会开始匹配你的指纹
That program will match you

824
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,440
但当他们发现你的真实身份后
and when they find out who you really are,

825
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,240
连我都没法把你救出来了
I won't be able to get you back out.

826
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,450
监狱生活可是水深火热
We're talking life in prison.

827
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,160
你孩子很可爱
Cute kid.

828
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:28,670
布拉加被关在监狱D-3区
So, I found out Braga's being held in cell block D3.

829
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,960
是单独的房间
That's solitary.

830
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,590
我只能把你安排在普通狱区
I only had enough juice to get you in Gen Pop.

831
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:36,260
所以你得有所行动让他注意到你
So you're going to have to do something to get his attention.

832
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,260
抱歉了伙计
Sorry about this, man.

833
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,430
什么抱歉
Sorry about what?

834
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,990
又来
Again?

835
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,450
看现场直播咯
Big Brother's about to go live.

836
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,090
在伦敦
Damn, you can't flick a

837
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,050
想偷偷摸摸干点事情还真难
booger in London without somebody noticing.

838
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,550
别乱碰  那可不是用来玩的
Hey! Don't touch that. That's nothing to play with, man.

839
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,720
怎么了啊
What's the problem?

840
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,810
那可是高张量钛电缆做的
That's high- tensile titanium cable.

841
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:21,520
那是什么啊
What does that mean?

842
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,560
是打地基和撑桥梁的材料
That's what they use to anchor buildings and hold up bridges,

843
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,730
不懂别乱碰
stuff you know nothing about!

844
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,400
他们做的版本 只能说是过得去
See, now, their version, it works cool,

845
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,570
我的可是大师手笔
but mine, masterpiece.

846
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:35,430
你看我把齿轮安到发动机后面去了
See, I reversed the gears, torqued the motor

847
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,760
还在后面加上了这个罐子
and added this tank to the back.

848
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:39,600
那就让我更想玩一把了
That makes it even sweeter.

849
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,720
这可是真枪实弹
It does.

850
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:42,100
不是模型
It's not dummy- proof.

851
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:44,560
我知道怎么操作大型枪支  放松点
Man, I've been known to handle big guns. Relax.

852
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,480
这个你可不会用
You've been known to handle that big- ass head.

853
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:49,400
唐  我做了点调查  询问了下周边情况
Dom, I did some checking, asked around,

854
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,440
找到了一处可以赛车的地方
got the location of a street race tonight.

855
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,170
四辆雪弗兰美式超跑
Four speed Camaro SS big block.

856
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,340
帅吧
You like it?

857
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,010
颜色真帅
Nice color.

858
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:50,410
布莱恩・奥康纳
Brian O'Conner.

859
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,750
真是巧遇啊
That was quite an entrance.

860
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,920
你抓了怎么多人进来
You put a lot of these men in here.

861
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:04,260
怎么  你觉得没人能认出你来吗
What? You didn't think one would recognize you?

862
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:09,810
大家可都记着你呢
I've kept tabs on you, you know.

863
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:12,640
你在外面玩的很开心啊
You've been having a lot of fun out there.

864
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:16,440
在里约热内卢时你变成了个坏警察
Good cop gone bad, Rio de Janeiro.

865
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:19,020
犯罪的感觉是不是很爽
It's exciting when you go criminal, isn't it?

866
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:22,320
你要是早点变成坏警察就可以为我干事了
Too bad you didn't do it earlier, you could have worked for me.

867
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:24,110
就像拉蒂・奥蒂斯一样是吗
Like Letty Ortiz?

868
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,320
告诉我点她的事  因为我亲手埋葬了她
So tell me something, because I buried her.

869
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,120
是吗
Yeah? You did?

870
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,870
我怎么知道你埋了什么
You buried something, I couldn't tell you who or what it was.

871
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,420
我知道她为肖工作
I know she's running with Owen Shaw.

872
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,790
布莱恩你还是有颗警察心啊
Still playing cop, huh?

873
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,050
就凭你的等级还不配知道这些
Trust me, this is way above your pay grade.

874
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:46,180
别嘲笑我了
Humor me, please.

875
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,810
反正你也是行尸走肉了  告诉你也无妨
Well, you're a dead man walking, what does it matter?

876
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:54,140
我替肖打理一切事物
I ran everything for Shaw.

877
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:57,810
毒品  枪支  金钱  女人
Drugs, guns, money, women.

878
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,820
在我眼光狭隘时他教会我把目光放远
He taught me to think global when I was just local.

879
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,480
我变富了
He made me a wealthy man.

880
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:04,690
不仅他的毒品集团为我工作
And this guy didn't just have the cartels working for him.

881
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:09,410
中情局  缉毒局  他控制着所有人
He had the CIA, DEA, everyone in his pocket.

882
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,830
他比他们更早掌握第一手消息
He knew what was going to happen before they did.

883
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:16,410
事实上他早就知道乳臭未干的FBI探员
In fact, he even knew when some wet- behind- the- ears FBI agent

884
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,710
打算把卧底安排进我的毒品集团的事
decided to put some informant in my cartel.

885
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:35,480
你让拉蒂做卧底结果害死了她
The minute you put Letty undercover, she was dead, bro.

886
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,720
她活下来了
But she survived.

887
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,730
这女孩命真硬
That girl is one tough bitch.

888
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:20,560
肖两天后在医院找到她
Shaw found her in a hospital two days later.

889
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,940
打算杀了她
He went to finish the job.

890
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:25,110
但他为什么没杀她
And he didn't kill her. Why?

891
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,900
她失忆了
She had no memory.

892
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,530
简直太完美了
Perfect girl, huh?

893
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:34,620
你该庆幸我们之间有道门隔着
You're lucky this door's between us.

894
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,380
你得为拉蒂的事负责
What happened to Letty is on your head.

895
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,040
看着我  看着我
Look at me! Look at me.

896
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:33,290
你不会杀我的
You won't do it.

897
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,460
肖到底有什么企图
What is Shaw up to?

898
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:39,550
他对你的行动了如指掌
How do you think he knows your next move before you make it?

899
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,340
他一直监视着你
He's got eyes on you.

900
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,130
想想吧
Think about it.

901
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,680
除非他想见你
The only way you get close to Shaw

902
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:51,480
否则你无法接近他
is if he wants you there.

903
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:37,620
你胆子还真大
You've got some serious balls, man.

904
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,420
都这么说
I've been told.

905
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,250
你很幸运我上次没射中你
You know, you're lucky I missed my shot.

906
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:44,420
我觉得你打得挺准
I think you hit your mark.

907
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:45,800
是吗
Really?

908
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,840
你到底想干嘛
What is it with you?

909
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:49,890
不想活了还是怎样
Do you got a death wish or something?

910
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,760
没什么大不了的
If that's what it takes.

911
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:53,770
我就是想赛一局
I just want to race.

912
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,640
你有可能会输掉你的车
You might lose your car.

913
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:02,190
来赛一局吧
Let's do it.

914
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:04,440
你死定了
Your funeral.

915
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:07,280
还记得吗  要么赛车要么死
Ride or die, remember?

916
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:17,120
都听好了
Listen up!

917
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:20,330
我们在这里追寻我们心之所向
Out here, we're used to getting what we want.

918
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,630
这里是伦敦  伙计们
This is London, baby.

919
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:24,710
但记住了
But remember,

920
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,880
别轻易上钩
don't bite the bait.

921
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,680
你们准备好了吗
Are you ready?

922
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,180
-准备好了吗  -好了
- Ready? - Ready.

923
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:37,180
稳住
Steady.

924
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:41,860
开始
Go!

925
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:34,780
简直是重温以前的时光啊
Just like old times.

926
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,040
这家伙真疯狂
This guy is crazy.

927
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:05,170
别开玩笑了
You got to be kidding me.

928
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:37,320
你换挡还是太早了
You're still upshifting early.

929
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:39,910
这样才能逼你刹车
I do that so you brake.

930
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:43,910
这样车尾就会打滑失控
You lose traction and the back end kicks out.

931
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:45,830
我注意到了
I noticed.

932
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,760
你知道我开车的习惯
Look, just because you know how I ride,

933
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,340
不代表你了解我本人
doesn't mean you know me.

934
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:54,260
那句话是怎么说的来着
You know what they say where we're from?

935
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:58,010
飙车给我看看  我会让你知道自己是谁
Show me how you drive, I'll show you who you are.

936
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:01,510
V8汽缸
V8.

937
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:05,020
你还是那么喜欢美国肌肉车
You never could resist American muscle.

938
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:10,520
伤疤挺漂亮
Nice scar.

939
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:18,860
你还是爱到处惹麻烦
You never could keep yourself out of trouble, either.

940
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:23,870
你还知道什么关于我的事儿
What else do you know about me?

941
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,370
关于你
About you?

942
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:30,330
我了解你的一切
Everything.

943
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,380
比如这条疤
Like this scar.

944
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:42,150
这是在咱俩第一次遇到那晚留下的
You got that the first night we met.

945
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:43,140
那时你才15岁
You were 15.

946
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,560
第一次参加绕圈赛
First street race.

947
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:50,310
有个想要出风头的小屁孩儿
Some kid trying to show off lost control of his car,

948
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,060
飙车失控了  车就在你身旁撞毁
wiped out right next to you.

949
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:55,440
没卸下你一条胳膊已经是万幸了
You're lucky you didn't lose your arm.

950
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:57,150
我猜猜
And let me guess,

951
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,740
是你救了我
you saved me.

952
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,410
不
No.

953
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:04,240
我就是那个想出风头的小屁孩儿
I was the kid showing off.

954
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:08,750
还有这里
And here...

955
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:17,090
博伊尔高地
Boyle Heights.

956
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:20,500
你在和我妹妹飙车
You were fleeing with my little sister Mia

957
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,180
被她逼得手忙脚乱
and got trapped in a corner.

958
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:25,600
你觉得飙着你的福特眼镜蛇
And you thought it was a good idea

959
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,430
穿墙而过是个绝佳的主意
to ride your Torino Cobra through a retaining wall.

960
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:35,770
好吧  那这条呢
All right, how about this one?

961
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,610
这是我们最后一次在一起的时候弄的
That's the last time we were together.

962
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,120
在DR时
In the DR.

963
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,700
你说你想晚上游泳
You wanted to go for a night swim.

964
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,210
结果被暗礁划伤了
You cut yourself on the reef.

965
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:55,290
我一路跟着你游
I followed you.

966
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:59,960
所以也被划了一道一模一样的
I even got this scar to match.

967
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:04,640
我不知道你为什么会出现
Look, I don't know why you're here,

968
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,640
但你肯定病的不轻
but I really think you're over your head.

969
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,150
我是为你而来的
I'm here for you.

970
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,360
你记忆里的那个女孩儿
That girl you remember,

971
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,910
并不是我
it's not me.

972
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:32,210
我只相信刚才亲眼所见的
Not from what I just saw.

973
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:36,080
随你怎么想
Like it or not,

974
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,920
但你一点也没变
you're still the same girl.

975
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:45,430
之前我就知道
I saw it out there.

976
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,260
现在更是坚信不疑
I see it right now.

977
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,140
我得走了
I got to go.

978
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:09,240
这是你的
It belongs to you.

979
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,530
她走了
There she goes,

980
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:47,070
又一次离开了你
leaving you again.

981
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,120
真他妈的绝情
Bloody fickle, that one.

982
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,330
你想来血腥暴力的我奉陪
You want bloody? We could do bloody.

983
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:59,380
一个街头小混混
A street kid,

984
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:03,170
在洛杉矶东部卖唱片机白手起家
starts out stealing DVD players in East L.A.,

985
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,220
最后则在里约偷了一亿然后金盆洗手
ends up heisting $100 million in Rio.

986
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,050
还不错吧
Not bad, huh?

987
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:12,220
是个美满的故事
It's a good story, isn't it?

988
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:15,230
简直让人羡慕了
Almost inspiring.

989
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,020
我不明白的是
See, what I couldn't fathom is

990
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,610
为啥他不愿意和那个美貌的巴西小妞
why he's not relaxing on a beach somewhere

991
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:24,230
安心在某个世外桃源隐居终老
with that cute little Brazilian number.

992
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:30,160
却要和政府的鹰爪霍布斯共事
Instead, he's working with a two- bit government hack like Hobbs.

993
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:34,700
然后我发现了
And then I realized,

994
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,750
他有一个弱点
he has a weak spot.

995
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,840
每个人都有弱点
We all got a weak spot.

996
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,520
在我年轻时
You know, when I was young,

997
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:49,680
我堂弟常说
my brother always used to say,

998
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,390
每个人都有自己的代名词
"Every man has to have a code."

999
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:54,600
我的是
Mine?

1000
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,560
缜密
Precision.

1001
01:15:57,890 --> 01:15:59,440
在任务完成之前整个团队
A team is nothing but pieces

1002
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,770
不过是分工合作的部件罢了
you switch out until you get the job done.

1003
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:03,190
高效
It's efficient.

1004
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:05,070
而且实用
It works.

1005
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:07,400
而你
But you?

1006
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:11,780
你却对错误的信念忠贞不渝
You're loyal to a fault.

1007
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:14,830
你的代名词和"家人"息息相关
Your code is about family.

1008
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,990
在闲暇之余可能还不错
And that's great in the holidays,

1009
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,660
但这也让我能轻松料到你的行动
but it makes you predictable.

1010
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:22,290
而这就代表着你很脆弱
And in our line of work, predictable means vulnerable.

1011
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:26,050
也就是说只要我想  随时都能打垮你
And that means I can reach out and break you whenever I want.

1012
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:29,260
但至少我知道我最终为何而死
At least when I go, I'll know what it's for.

1013
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:35,140
至少你还有个代名词
Well, at least you have a code.

1014
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,890
大多数人都没有
Most men don't.

1015
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:47,280
那我给你一个机会
So, I'm going to give you a chance.

1016
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:50,900
带着你的团队走人吧
Take your crew and walk away.

1017
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:53,660
这是唯一能保你整个家族周全的法子
That's the only way you're going to keep your family safe.

1018
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,160
你弟没教过你别拿家人作威胁人的筹码吗
Your brother never told you never to threaten a man's family?

1019
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,250
我承认是做了件傻事
It's a pretty stupid thing to do.

1020
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,840
但我也开门见山地说吧
But I'll make it simple for you.

1021
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:12,180
她和这事儿脱了干系后我才会罢休
I walk away when she walks away.

1022
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,930
好吧
Well, then,

1023
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:19,970
看来这个令人羡慕的故事要走到头了
it appears this inspiring tale has come to an end.

1024
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:29,650
如果你真打算这么干的话
If that's the way it has to go.

1025
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,740
让我猜猜
Let me guess...

1026
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,160
是霍布斯吧
Hobbs.

1027
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:47,130
放马过来  王八蛋
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1028
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:49,750
政府的鹰爪
The "Two- bit government hack."

1029
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:58,890
再会了  托雷多
See you around, Toretto.

1030
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:00,560
我们会再见的
You can bet on it.

1031
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:18,320
莱利  肖驱车从巴特西往东南方向逃走了
Riley, Shaw's leaving Battersea, heading southeast.

1032
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:20,240
让泰吉去追踪他的车
Have Tej track him on his live feed. Go.

1033
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:22,870
我在想
You know what would have happened

1034
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:25,580
如果我没在你车里放跟踪器会怎样
if I didn't put that tracker in your car?

1035
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,040
这个吗
This one?

1036
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:40,310
这玩意儿让我离抓到肖又进了一步
You know, this just got me one step closer to Shaw.

1037
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:42,770
不论如何  托雷多
For what it's worth, Toretto,

1038
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:45,940
希望你也能早点实现你的目的
I hope it gets you closer to what you want, too.

1039
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,790
这么做最好值得
This better have been worth it.

1040
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:06,250
是值了
More than you'll ever know.

1041
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,250
美女
Pretty.

1042
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,300
能给我看看吗
May I?

1043
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:16,990
我得问你个问题  拉蒂
I'm going to ask you a question, Letty,

1044
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:21,610
请你三思之后再回答
and I want you to think very hard before you answer.

1045
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,700
当我下令
When I give you the order

1046
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:26,290
让你杀了托雷多时
to take Toretto out,

1047
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:31,290
你脑海中的第一反应是什么
what will your first thought be?

1048
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:35,630
你怎么不看着我的眼睛
Why don't you look me in the eye

1049
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:40,470
然后告诉我你看到了什么
and you tell me what you see.

1050
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,810
留着吧
Keep it.

1051
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:02,700
快说说情况如何了
Tej, talk to me, what have we got?

1052
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:05,200
现在是能追踪到肖了
We were able to track Shaw after he left you and Dom,

1053
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:06,360
但他也学聪明了
but this guy's smart,

1054
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,990
所以我们也只能追踪到那么远
so we could only track him so far.

1055
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,540
他知道城里所有摄像头的盲区
He seems to know all the city's blind spots.

1056
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:12,000
我们在这一带跟丢了他
See, we lost him somewhere in here,

1057
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:15,130
所以他可能在这附近半英里的范围内
which means he could be anywhere within that half- a- mile radius.

1058
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:18,210
只要我们排查一下通话记录和租房信息
Maybe if we cross- reference phone records, leases...

1059
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:20,420
不  这就是肖的行事风格
No, this has got Shaw's name written all over it.

1060
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:22,720
这一段岔路极多
We've got vantage points, multiple exits,

1061
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,340
还有地铁  高速路和下水道
subways, highways and storm drains.

1062
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:26,010
真伤脑筋啊
Bad- ass and brains.

1063
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,140
你再说下去我只有下岗了
Woman, you keep that up, I'm going to be out of a job.

1064
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,140
好吧  咱们去抓那个王八蛋
All right, let's go nail that son of a bitch.

1065
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,000
他们早就走了
They're long gone.

1066
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:58,630
这儿什么都没剩下
There's nothing here.

1067
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,180
也不尽然
There's never nothing.

1068
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:18,400
总会有些蛛丝马迹的
There's always something.

1069
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:26,200
出发吧伙计们
Let's go, guys.

1070
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:32,080
肖  全员就位  一切照计划进行
Shaw, everyone is in place. All things moving according to plan.

1071
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:37,290
很好  让他们上
Good. Send him in.

1072
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:42,550
霍布斯打来的
Yo, it's Hobbs.

1073
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:46,220
有什么发现  帕克  给我些好消息吧
What have you got, Parker? Give me something good.

1074
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:48,690
有  你在肖的地盘找到的涂料
Yeah, that paint you got from Shaw's place

1075
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:49,970
是专门定制的
is highly specialized.

1076
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:52,310
可以防止雷达侦测的涂料
Anti- thermal low- IR coating.

1077
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:54,430
-军用涂料  -正是
- Military. - Exactly.

1078
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,270
有一清单欧洲军事基地都在用这种涂料
We got a list of bases around Europe that use this paint type

1079
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,610
还没有特定的颜色
and those specific colors.

1080
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:01,980
那就通查一遍所有肖的军事目标
All right, let's cross- reference that with all of Shaw's military targets.

1081
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:04,440
总会有吻合的
I guaran- damn- tee you one of them is gonna match.

1082
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:06,490
搞定
Bingo.

1083
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:09,160
是西班牙的一个北约军事基地
It's a NATO base in Spain.

1084
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,780
那意味着肖去了别的国家
That puts Shaw in a different country.

1085
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,740
这样他已经领先我们8个小时了
That means he's got an eight- hour lead on us.

1086
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:13,850
所以我们现在就该动身了
We gotta move now.

1087
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:15,080
泰吉  把数据传给我
Tej, give me that info.

1088
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:17,580
莱利和我现在就去锁定那个基地的位置
Riley and I will go ahead and we're going to lock down the base.

1089
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:19,830
我们得靠自己去保护那个装置了
We're going to protect that component personally.

1090
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,710
托雷多  立即把你的人和车调过来
Toretto, I'll arrange transportation for you and your cars.

1091
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:26,670
换上你的西班牙装备  咱们西班牙见
You brush up on your Spanish, boys. I'll see you en EspaГ±a.

1092
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:33,730
北约基地  鲁斯塔尼恩  西班牙

1093
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,120
你个狗娘养的  居然成功了
You son of a bitch! You made it!

1094
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,990
-别来无恙啊  伙计  -真高兴见到你  
- What up, man? - Good to see you.

1095
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,540
我也是  这是要干什么去
Good to see you. So, what's going on here?

1096
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,500
查出他们要袭击西班牙的一个军事基地
Figured out they're hitting an army base in Spain.

1097
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:01,330
肖的手下夜里越过了边境
Border patrol ID'ed Shaw's men crossing through last night.

1098
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,590
霍布斯和莱利先去警告对方了
Hobbs and Riley went to lock down the base.

1099
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:05,170
-我们在那边汇合  -唐在哪里
- They're going to meet us there. - Where's Dom?

1100
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,090
你没回来他不愿意走
He wasn't going without you.

1101
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,350
我查清楚拉蒂身上到底发生了什么了
I found out what happened to Letty.

1102
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:18,230
都怪我
It's all my fault.

1103
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:20,350
布莱恩
Brian,

1104
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:23,220
不论你查到了什么
whatever you found out,

1105
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:24,610
都只是为你自己而查
that's for you.

1106
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:27,150
而我们现在要做的
What we're about to do now

1107
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:30,450
是要让她回来
is for her.

1108
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:35,910
我们设置了四支小队警戒巡逻
We've got four teams on overwatch,

1109
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,870
目标周围的制高点也安插了狙击手
sniper- spotters in roosts north and south of the target.

1110
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,540
把你的人都调开
Just keep all your men out of sight.

1111
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:41,710
他们开着卡车冲进来时
When they drive that truck in here,

1112
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:44,420
圣经中坚不可摧的城池 后崩毁

1113
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:44,420
我希望能像推倒耶利哥之墙那样碾碎他们
I want to come crashing down on them like the walls of Jericho.

1114
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:45,020
霍布斯
Hobbs,

1115
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:49,090
这家伙想关闭保卫系统
I just caught this one disabling the perimeter security system.

1116
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:50,380
你的基地已经不安全了
Your house is compromised.

1117
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,470
有什么建议
What are you suggesting?

1118
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:52,680
我不是在提建议
I ain't suggesting.

1119
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,970
按着计划来  我们把目标转移出去
We follow protocol, we move the component out.

1120
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:55,980
肖以为东西在这儿
Shaw thinks it's here.

1121
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:57,970
我们要在肖到这儿前把目标转移走
We're going to get it out of here before he arrives.

1122
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,020
我们最需要的就是隐蔽和快速
Stealth and speed are going to be our two best friends.

1123
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,270
先把鸡蛋从鸡窝里拿出去
We're going to protect our little egg, move it out of the henhouse,

1124
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:05,690
再等着那狡猾的老狐狸自投罗网
then we're going to wait for that goddamn fox to arrive.

1125
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:11,570
他们在基地里抓住了一个肖的手下
I just got word they caught one of Shaw's men at the base.

1126
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:12,860
是时候了
It's time.

1127
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:14,590
感觉不大对劲
Something is not right.

1128
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:16,660
他故意让我们发现那个人
He wanted us to find that guy.

1129
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:19,700
还记得在国际刑警总部  你们对上他了
Think about it. At Interpol, you were face- to- face with him.

1130
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:21,620
布莱恩  那你说怎么办
Brian, so what are you saying?

1131
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:27,210
布拉加说找到肖的唯一途径就是等他来找你
Braga said the only way you get near Shaw is if he wants you to.

1132
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,670
泰吉  装置现在在哪儿
Tej, where's that component?

1133
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:31,670
正被运往一处安全的地方
They're moving it to a secure location.

1134
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,390
肖的目的不是要袭击那个基地
Shaw ain't hitting that base.

1135
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,770
他是想引出运输车队中途拦截
He's hitting the convoy.

1136
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:16,300
行动
Let's go!

1137
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,130
报告说运输车队受到攻击
We've got a report, the convoy's under attack.

1138
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:48,250
上直升机  快
Get a chopper, now!

1139
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:07,310
你们最好快点  他们已经控制了车队
Fellas, you better hurry up. They just took the convoy.

1140
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,230
对了  唐
And Dom,

1141
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,990
拉蒂也来了
Letty's with them.

1142
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:17,070
一切照计划实施
We stick to the plan.

1143
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:24,790
大家听好了
All right, you heard the man.

1144
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:26,080
咱们要干净利落地解决这事
Let's play this fast and clean.

1145
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,170
目标正前往你们所在的路上
That thing's heading your way.

1146
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:06,540
所有系统就绪
All systems go.

1147
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:08,710
一切就绪
Everything looks stable.

1148
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:11,540
伙计们  我们得另想一个计划了
Uh, guys, we gotta come up with another plan.

1149
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:15,880
他们整了辆坦克
They got a tank.

1150
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:18,470
抱歉  刚才是有人说什么"坦克"吗
I'm sorry, did somebody just say "A tank"?

1151
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:25,970
咱们有伴儿了
We got company, guys.

1152
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:28,390
托雷多冲你来了
Toretto is coming right at you.

1153
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,190
准备好武器
Okay. Get the weapons hot.

1154
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:34,730
把卫星影像传输给我
Give me satellite imaging.

1155
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:30,540
就在正前方
Straight ahead of us.

1156
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:32,750
就是你了
There you are.

1157
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,930
谁有B计划
Who's got a plan B?

1158
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:50,430
B计划吗  B计划哪够
Plan B? Plan B?

1159
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:51,640
我们还需要C计划  D计划  E计划
We need a plan C, D, E.

1160
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:52,980
字母表都不够用了
We need more alphabets!

1161
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:56,270
听着  我们尽力吧
Hey, we do what we do best.

1162
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:57,900
随机应变行了吧
We improvise, all right?

1163
01:30:14,170 --> 01:30:17,170
约翰  去另一边车道
Okay, Jah. Take it to the other side.

1164
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:18,670
我们来玩点儿刺激的
Let's have some fun.

1165
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:37,110
你他妈的是不是有病  这不在计划里
What the hell is wrong with you? This isn't part of the plan.

1166
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:51,870
把他们的注意力从无辜的人身上引开
Take their attention away from the people!

1167
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:06,840
肖  你没必要做的这么绝
Shaw, you don't have to do this.

1168
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,560
我们前面有个送上门来的
We got one right in front of us.

1169
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:23,900
真他妈见鬼
Oh, shit!

1170
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,580
你可真是狗屎运
You lucky bastard.

1171
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,330
罗姆  挺住啊
Roman, you hang in there.

1172
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,080
坚持住  伙计
Hang in there, man!

1173
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:44,170
你们谁来做点什么  有辆坦克咬我屁股
Somebody better do something! I got a tank on my ass!

1174
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:48,090
前面有个缺口
There's gotta be a break up ahead.

1175
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,720
看啊
Oh, look,

1176
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,770
有个桥
a bridge.

1177
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:26,970
管他娘的
Screw it.

1178
01:33:03,170 --> 01:33:05,000
我们后面拖着辆车
We're dragging a car behind us.

1179
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:09,130
布莱恩  我们必须得去给他们点儿回报
Brian, that Mustang would make a nice anchor.

1180
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,470
我这就去
Yeah, I'm on it.

1181
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:36,700
他妈的
Damn!

1182
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:38,620
肖  我们得摆脱后面那辆车
Shaw, we've got to get rid of that car.

1183
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:41,330
拉蒂  你来解决那难缠的缆线
Letty, go take care of the cable.

1184
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:02,060
她在干什么
What's she doing?

1185
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:03,390
该死
Shit!

1186
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:05,730
现在轮到你了  托雷多
Okay, Toretto.

1187
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:09,570
你的女人在这儿
Here's your girl...

1188
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:14,280
来个幸福结局吧
And your happy ending.

1189
01:34:14,450 --> 01:34:15,620
拉蒂
Letty!

1190
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:53,440
我的老天啊
Jesus Christ.

1191
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:02,950
难以置信他们偷了辆70吨的坦克
I can't believe they stole a 70- ton tank

1192
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,410
只为了得到三盎司电脑芯片
for a three- ounce computer chip.

1193
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:06,090
那三盎司电脑芯片
That 3- ounce computer chip

1194
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:08,460
比坦克要致命上千倍
is more deadly than 1,000 of those tanks.

1195
01:35:12,010 --> 01:35:13,630
那她呢
What about her?

1196
01:35:14,130 --> 01:35:15,800
她没问题
Not her.

1197
01:35:15,970 --> 01:35:17,430
她为肖卖命
She was working with Shaw.

1198
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:18,680
已经过去了
Was,

1199
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:22,810
她一直是我们中的一员
but she's always been one of us.

1200
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:27,770
给他们点时间
Let's give them a minute.

1201
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:43,660
得对付肖的同伙们了
Let's go process Shaw and his crew.

1202
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:44,880
要写的报告
I've never looked more

1203
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:47,000
这辈子都写不完了
forward to filling out paperwork in my life.

1204
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:11,690
我不知道该怎么跟你说
Look, I don't even know how to say this to you,

1205
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,700
但这一切都因我而起
but everything that's happened here is because of me.

1206
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:20,700
都怪我你才落到如此境地
I'm the one that put you undercover...

1207
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:22,530
别这么说
Stop.

1208
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:25,200
我虽然之前的事都不记得了
I may not remember anything,

1209
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:29,210
但是我确定我自己的一点
but I know one thing about myself.

1210
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:32,750
那就是没有人能强迫我做我不想做的事
Nobody makes me do anything I don't want to.

1211
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:48,310
这之后的下一段冒险你想去哪儿
So, what's our next adventure after this?

1212
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:53,940
我们一起度过如何
How about we stay in one place?

1213
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:55,940
你想去哪儿
Where are you thinking?

1214
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:57,650
东京
Tokyo.

1215
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,740
我们总是聊到东京
We always talk about Tokyo.

1216
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:04,410
就去东京吧
Tokyo it is.

1217
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:13,590
我能问你点事吗
Can I ask you something?

1218
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:22,860
你怎么会知道
How did you know that

1219
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:25,760
那有辆车会接住我们
there would be a car there to break our fall?

1220
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,100
我不知道
I didn't.

1221
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:35,650
有时你只需依靠信念
Some things you just have to take on faith.

1222
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:38,740
托雷多
Hey, Toretto!

1223
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,610
你来听一下
You need to hear this.

1224
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:57,460
你们不会真以为你们赢了吧
You guys really think you've won.

1225
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:00,090
就是你们崇尚的忠诚
This code you live by,

1226
01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:04,140
让你们到现在都搞不清状况
it's the very reason why you weren't even in the game.

1227
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:09,050
我跟你说过我会做什么
I told you exactly what I was gonna do

1228
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:10,140
如果你不退出  托雷多
if you didn't walk away, Toretto.

1229
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:12,270
快走
Go!

1230
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:14,650
但是你不听
But you didn't listen.

1231
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:19,690
我说过我随时能摧毁你们
I told you I can reach out and break you whenever I want.

1232
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:23,950
而且我已经做到了
And I have.

1233
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:25,110
快下来
Come on.

1234
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:29,370
-不  快走  -不
- Go. - No!

1235
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:31,700
也许你该给米娅打个电话
Maybe you should call Mia.

1236
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:46,890
-米娅  -布莱恩
- Mia? - Brian!

1237
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:51,680
放开我
Let me go!

1238
01:39:04,990 --> 01:39:07,700
这笔交易算是成交了吧
So, this is how it's gonna go down.

1239
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,200
乖乖帮我把手铐解开
You're gonna cut me loose from these cuffs,

1240
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:11,910
把芯片交给我
you're gonna hand me the chip,

1241
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,080
放我安全出去  不许跟踪我
I'm gonna walk out of here and you're not gonna follow.

1242
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:16,420
你开什么玩笑
You must be joking.

1243
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:21,670
看看他的表情
Look at his face.

1244
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:27,050
问问他我是不是在开玩笑
Ask him if I'm joking.

1245
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:31,930
一名人质的安危无法和百万市民匹敌
One hostage does not outweigh the threat to millions.

1246
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:36,770
抱歉  这对我来说没影响
I'm sorry, but this changes nothing.

1247
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:43,190
可是对我们有
It changes everything.

1248
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:47,280
你命令你的人退下
You tell your men to stand down.

1249
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:51,910
退下
Stand down.

1250
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:55,250
托雷多
Toretto,

1251
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:57,460
我需要你明白
I need you to know,

1252
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:01,210
我们让他带着芯片出了那扇门的一刻
the moment we let him walk out that door with that chip,

1253
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:04,420
"撤销""赦免"什么的
words like "Amnesty" And "Pardon"

1254
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:06,260
可就都没了
walk out with him.

1255
01:40:11,930 --> 01:40:15,770
我们生来就跟这个没缘分
Those words went out the day we were born.

1256
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:46,800
走吧  宝贝儿
Coming, babe?

1257
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:53,640
当然
Of course.

1258
01:40:55,470 --> 01:40:57,140
我可不想错过这个
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1259
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,560
像我刚刚说的
Like I said,

1260
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:06,400
你永远赢不了这场游戏
you were never in the game.

1261
01:41:07,190 --> 01:41:08,900
很快我们还会见面的
If I see you on the horizon,

1262
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:11,280
我会打电话叫他们别弄死那女的
I'll make the call and the girl's dead.

1263
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,590
托雷多的妹妹怎么办
So, what about Toretto's sister?

1264
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:30,180
留着她没用了
There's no need for her anymore.

1265
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,600
我刚刚把这片区域发出的信号都锁定了
I just jammed every signal up and down the spectrum.

1266
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:42,520
我们出发
Let's move.

1267
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:45,020
我和你们一起去
I'm coming with you.

1268
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:20,060
这家伙到底想往哪里跑
Where the hell does this dude think he's going?

1269
01:42:20,230 --> 01:42:22,430
他被困在这个军事基地了
We're on an army base, he's trapped.

1270
01:42:30,570 --> 01:42:32,820
你个乌鸦嘴能闭上吗
Wow, you just had to open your mouth.

1271
01:42:33,110 --> 01:42:35,110
现在我们有个大飞机要对付
Now we got a big- ass plane to deal with.

1272
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,450
不只是架飞机  简直是个星球
That ain't a plane. That's a planet.

1273
01:42:42,450 --> 01:42:43,450
打开货舱门

1274
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:58,260
如果肖上飞机逃了你妹妹就死定了
She's as good as dead if Shaw gets away on that plane.

1275
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:03,940
我们不会让他逃走的
Then we don't let him get away.

1276
01:43:11,610 --> 01:43:13,780
我们现在就搞定他们
Let's end this thing.

1277
01:43:22,330 --> 01:43:23,580
不飙宁死
Ride or die.

1278
01:43:24,660 --> 01:43:25,750
不飙宁死
Ride or die.

1279
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:52,750
让他们起飞
Tell them to take off!

1280
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:56,750
起飞  起飞

1281
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:58,750
已经超载了  我们要提速

1282
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:04,890
宝贝  送我到机翼下面
Babe, get me under the wing.

1283
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:07,560
如果我能击中副翼  就能阻止它起飞
If I can hit that flap, we can keep it from taking off.

1284
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,730
你小心点
You be careful.

1285
01:45:14,730 --> 01:45:16,570
这就是我们的工作
This is who we are.

1286
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:29,750
该死
Shit!

1287
01:45:30,310 --> 01:45:31,590
外面发生什么事了

1288
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:34,420
握紧方向盘
Grab the wheel!

1289
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:25,180
唐
Dom!

1290
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:33,600
走啊
Go!

1291
01:46:33,810 --> 01:46:35,100
快走
Come on. Let's go.

1292
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:52,460
先进车里
Get in the car.

1293
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:44,940
够起飞速度了

1294
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:45,630
那就起飞吧

1295
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,860
发生什么事了  你击中了飞机
What happened? Did you hit the flap?

1296
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:08,620
你最好系好安全带
You should buckle up right now.

1297
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:09,780
啥
What?

1298
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:31,930
站错队了  婊子
Wrong team, bitch.

1299
01:51:16,550 --> 01:51:17,590
该死
Shit.

1300
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,300
我抓住你了
I got you.

1301
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:25,360
他们击中了副翼

1302
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,750
他们要把我们拖垮了

1303
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:58,310
抬高  抬高

1304
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:06,700
泰吉
Tej!

1305
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:08,200
保持这个速度
Keep her steady!

1306
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:10,790
-快走  飞机要坠毁了  -走
- We gotta move, it's going down! - Go!

1307
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,210
走  现在
Go, now!

1308
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:22,470
快跳  快跳
Come on, let's move, move, move!

1309
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:29,720
跳呀
Come on!

1310
01:53:33,810 --> 01:53:35,150
唐
Dom!

1311
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:41,870
吉赛尔呢
Where's Gisele?

1312
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:47,710
吉赛尔去哪儿了
Where's Gisele?

1313
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:19,870
就是这东西值十几亿
So this is worth billions, huh?

1314
01:57:24,370 --> 01:57:25,790
没错  就是它
Yes, it is.

1315
01:57:30,590 --> 01:57:31,880
开个价吧  唐
Name your price, Dom.

1316
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,260
1327
1327.

1317
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:07,000
这次别烧焦了
Don't burn it this time. Please?

1318
01:58:07,170 --> 01:58:09,500
我什么时候烧焦过
I never go and burn it, man.

1319
01:58:11,670 --> 01:58:13,260
有好吃的
Good food.

1320
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:17,930
空气质量不好  交通状况也很差
The air quality here is lousy, the traffic is bad,

1321
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:20,350
但我觉得你会喜欢这地方
but I think you'll learn to like this place.

1322
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:23,020
你都有自己的车库了
Yeah, and here you've got your own garage

1323
01:58:23,140 --> 01:58:25,140
你可以和老爹一起改车了
so you can build a car with Daddy.

1324
01:58:25,190 --> 01:58:26,310
我们一起来改车吗
We'll be building a car?

1325
01:58:26,350 --> 01:58:28,860
第一辆车最好是道奇Charger  杰克
First car better be a Charger, Jack.

1326
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:30,860
日产跑车

1327
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:31,150
是天际才对
You mean Skyline.

1328
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:34,530
我说过他是托雷多家的人
Like I said, he's a Toretto.

1329
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:36,200
宝宝都凌乱了
You're confusing the kid.

1330
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:37,530
米娅  你就这么由着他吗
Mia, you're gonna let him get away with this?

1331
01:58:37,700 --> 01:58:39,120
你真要这样吗
You're really going to do it?

1332
01:58:39,950 --> 01:58:40,990
去东京
Tokyo.

1333
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:44,870
我还有事要处理
Yeah, it's just something I gotta do.

1334
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:48,370
你是知道我们会支持你的  随叫随到
You know we got your back, whenever you need us.

1335
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:54,880
米娅  快把婴儿润肤油藏起来
Hey, Mia, you better hide your baby oil.

1336
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,010
开个玩笑
I'm just playing.

1337
01:58:56,050 --> 01:58:57,720
你最好藏起脸上那张大屁股
You better hide that big- ass forehead.

1338
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:59,140
就是个玩笑
I was just joking, but whatever.

1339
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:01,050
没那么好笑好吗
Definitely not that funny.

1340
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:02,890
这是官方文件
It's official.

1341
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,220
你们都被赦免了
You're all free.

1342
01:59:08,230 --> 01:59:10,730
有你替我效力也挺不错的
It wasn't half bad, having you work for me.

1343
01:59:13,070 --> 01:59:15,400
明明就是你在为我服务
We all know you were working for me, Hobbs.

1344
01:59:16,070 --> 01:59:18,360
各抒己见
Agree to disagree.

1345
01:59:18,530 --> 01:59:19,570
多谢啦
Thank you.

1346
01:59:20,530 --> 01:59:21,740
祝你好运
Good luck.

1347
01:59:23,410 --> 01:59:24,410
伊莲娜
Elena?

1348
